# 🌱 ACIL — A Small Experiment Built in Public

![ACIL Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fathoni733/ACILtoken/main/ACIL.png)

**ACIL** is a small experimental project created by a beginner developer to **learn, explore, and document a Web3 journey in public**.

No hype. No promises. Just learning by doing.

---

## 🧠 What Is ACIL?
ACIL started as a **tiny meme token on BNB Chain**, but the idea is bigger than the token itself.

This project is about:
- Learning crypto & Web3 from zero  
- Building in public  
- Experimenting without pressure  
- Sharing progress, mistakes, and lessons openly  

ACIL is represented as a **curious little kid** exploring the Web3 world step by step.

## 🔗 Token Experiment (Optional)
ACIL includes a **token experiment** deployed on BNB Smart Chain.

| Item | Info |
|------|------|
| Symbol | ACIL |
| Total Supply | 1,000,000,000 |
| Network | BNB Smart Chain (BSC) |
| Contract | `0x101D76aE634f8AFba9650Ba351DF94EC38bA4DC9` |

The token exists mainly as:

- a way to understand liquidity, deployment, and on-chain behavior  

It may grow, stagnate, or disappear — all outcomes are acceptable.
